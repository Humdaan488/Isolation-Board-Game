# Isolation-Board-Game
Developed a multi-user board game consisting of a grid of tiles on which players alternately make moves to isolate and trap their opponent. Several object-oriented programming principles were applied as a competitive game structure was incorporated. Testing procedures were carried out to debug and resolve any issues in order to ensure the game ran smothly.
